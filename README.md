🚀 CrewAI Multi-Agent Example

A beginner-friendly project demonstrating how to build and run a multi-agent AI team using CrewAI, where agents have different roles, tasks, and collaborate to produce a combined output.

📌 Features

Role-based AI agents

One task per agent

Sequential task execution

Multi-agent collaboration

Combined output from all agents

Explicit LLM configuration (Groq)

🧠 About CrewAI

CrewAI is an open-source framework that allows developers to:

Create and manage teams of AI agents

Define agent roles, goals, and backstories

Assign tasks and let the crew autonomously execute them

Enable human-AI and AI-AI collaboration

🧑‍💼 Agents in This Project
Agent	Role	Responsibility
Agent 1	Python Assistant	Prints “Hello World”
Agent 2	Philosopher	Explains the meaning of life from literature

Each agent:

Has a role

Has a goal

Has a backstory

Works only on its assigned task

📋 Tasks

Each task is assigned to one specific agent

Tasks run sequentially

The final output is a combined result from all agents

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python

CrewAI

Groq LLM (llama-3.1-8b-instant)

Pydantic (used internally by CrewAI for data validation)

🔐 LLM Configuration

CrewAI defaults to OpenAI if no LLM is specified.

⚠️ When using a non-OpenAI provider (like Groq), the LLM must be explicitly defined:

llm="groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant"

🔑 Environment Variables

Set your Groq API key before running the code.

macOS / Linux
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

Windows (PowerShell)
setx GROQ_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"

▶️ How to Run
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

📤 Output

The program prints a single combined output generated by all agents in the crew, demonstrating collaborative AI behavior.
