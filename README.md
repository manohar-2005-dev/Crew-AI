# Crew-AI
This example shows how CrewAI creates multiple role-based AI agents, each with a clear goal and backstory. Every task is owned by a specific agent and executed sequentially. The agents work like AI employees—one as a Python assistant and another as a philosopher and the final output is a combined result from the entire crew.
